# Assessing Regional Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise on the North American East Coast as a Factor of Atmospheric Forcing on Ocean Circulation
## Lindsay Chu 2025/2026 Undergraduate Research Project
This page serves as the project description for my undergraduate research project, conducted under the supervision of Dr. James Carton of the University of Maryland's Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Department. Credit will be recieved for this course in tandem with the AOSC499 course offering over the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters. 

# Project Description
## Goals:
- Evaluate sea level rise data from the North American East Coast to identify trends
- Examine North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability and its impacts on regional wind patterns/wind stress and ocean circulation (particularly on the Gulf Stream)
- Examine AMOC and Gulf Stream variability (with a focus on wind-driven processes) in response to altered atmospheric and oceanic processes under various climate change scenarios
- Assess SLR risk for regions along the East Coast as a result of Atmospheric and Oceanic interactions 
- Account for regional subsidence and other geological factors contributing to variations in sea level
- Identify areas of high and low vulnerability to SLR along the North American East Coast 

## Tasks
This section will be updated as needed to reflect most-recent progress on the project.
- [ ] Beginning acquisition of wind field and subsidence data for respective stations
- [ ] Beginning data analysis of monthly data, computing linear and quadratic trends for each station over time
- [x] Downloaded and cleaned Monthly Tide Gauge data from PSMSL
  - [x] Wrote MATLAB script to clean txt data (date correction, accuracy assessment, etc.), and convert to .csv and/or .xlsx files
- [x] Created basic ArcGIS Pro map listing all stations currently accounted for (view map here: https://uofmd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=b1ba92082fb24eb78e508469e5a3ed79)
- [x] Selected Stations providing monthly data (see spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gy-OrPBqSnwzm830RdczyI_7Te8s8pdkHp8mAuuROf4/edit?usp=sharing)
